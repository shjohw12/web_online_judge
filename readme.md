# Online algorithm judge

## Project overview

![Alt text](p1.png)

It is a web project that implements the behavior of actual online algorithm judge.

Users can read problems or submit source codes through web pages. When a user submits a source code, the server receives the code and executes it to measure time and memory, and checks whether the output is the same as the correct answer.

The user's web interface was implemented using html, css, and javascript and the scoring server must run in a linux environment because measuring time/memory and executing the code submitted by the user uses the POSIX API.

Time and memory measurements are implemented through unix/linux system programming using C language, and submission data is received from users through flask and REST APIs(GET, POST), and the results output by the scoring program are delivered back to the user's web interface.

In addition, gcc, python3 and python's flask library should be installed on linux environment.

### Log in page

![Alt text](p6.png)

It's a login page. You can enter the ID and password of the account to enter the main page.

If the ID does not exist or the password is wrong, the above message appears and you cannot log in.

***

### Main page

![Alt text](p8.png)

If you have entered your ID and password correctly, you can enter the main page.
On the menu bar, If you press "problems" you enter the problem list page, if you press "ranking" you enter the ranking page, and if you press "logout", you will log out.

***

### Problems page

![Alt text](p10.png)

You can see the list of problems. you can see the problem ID, the problem name, the time limit, and the memory limit. Only prolem 1000 and problem 1001 are available in the project. If the administrator wants to add a problem, the problem can be added by adding data(1.in, 1.out, â€¦) to the backend(linux server) and adding a "problem_[id].html" file to the frontend.

### Problem/submission page

![Alt text](p11.png)

It's a problem/submission page. There is a problem description, sample input/output, and submission area.
Enter the code in the text area and press the Submit button to complete the submission. If you do not select a submission language or enter a code, the message appears and you cannot submit it.

After checking the results, there is a button that allows you to enter the main page.

### Ranking page

![Alt text](p18.png)

On the ranking page, you can see the ranking of each user.

## Backend details

![Alt text](p19.png)

Run backend.py in linux environment. In my case, I proceeded in WSL(Windows Subsystem Linux). The server is now ready to receive source code from the user. Let's submit the source code on the web page.

![Alt text](p20.png)

After submission, you will be directed to the following page.

Upon completion of the submission, the server normally receives source code data through the GET request, and the checker.c executable returns the result of measuring the output and time/memory of the user's program to the user (web page) through a POST request.

When the server completes the evaluation, the results can be checked on web page message.
